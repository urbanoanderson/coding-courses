Unlike other books or courses that teach Entity Framework like a manual, Mosh walks you through real-world scenarios using his extensive experience in the field. Not only does he teach you the fundamentals of Entity Framework, he'll also teach you best practices along the way.

In each section, you'll find exercises to help you reinforce the materials. These exercises have been chosen from real-world scenarios to help you prepare for the challenges of the real-world. Also, some sections include cheat sheets so you can quickly review what you learn in that section.

This course is produced with Entity Framework 6. If you're using an older version of Entity Framework, you can still take this course as long as your version of Entity Framework is 4.1 or higher.

## Notes

Code produced was adapted to use EntityFrameworkCore 2.1.0 and SQLite instead of the original EntityFramework 6 with SQLExpress planned for the course.
